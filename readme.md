HTML:
  HTML was kept as minimal as possible. Bootstrap.css, along with slate.css (Bootswatch template) was used for simplicity.

Styling:
 Used bootstrap.css, animate.css, slate.css, and created a simplesimon.css for a clean style.

JavaScript:
  First simplesimon.js file was created with sound and had issues with functions.  After attempting to cleanup the file,
  a decision was made to create another file simplesimon2.js to ensure simple functionality.


Possible future game changes will be:
   -  Adding sounds and animation to enhance user experience
   -  Creating a difficulty level as levels increase
   -  Not allowing the user to click when Simon is playing sequence
